What are Principles? 

  Principles are decision-making guiders. 
  Every principle has the purpose of boosting your odds of success through de-centralized decision-making to boost love & reduce suffering, which is currently the purpose of my life. 
  With other words, I'm trying to achieve a better world for everyone by gathering lessons for which decisions will get me that result.
  The purpose of this process is cost-efficient reproducibility of the best decision. Not making the same mistake twice is crucial for getting results. 
  Reducing the imperfection of your mental representations of reality through deliberate practice is the route to evolving.
  Evolving is the journey to engage in to increase the chance of reaching any goal for any purpose. 

  CRUDding principles is a way to outsource evolution of any area of life to exposure to that area of life, by practically acting in these. applying principles in complex sub-systems of reality.
